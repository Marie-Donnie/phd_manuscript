abstract = {Edge applications, such as gaming, cooperative engineering, or in-the-field information sharing, enjoy immediate response, autonomy and availability by distributing and replicating data at the edge. However, application developers and users demand the highest possible consistency guarantees, and specific support for group collaboration. To address this challenge, Colony guarantees Transactional Causal Plus Consistency (TCC+) globally, strengthened to Snapshot Isolation within edge groups. To help with scalability, fault tolerance and security, its logical communication topology is forest-like, with replicated roots in the core cloud, but with the flexibility to migrate a node or a group. Despite this hybrid approach, applications enjoy the same semantics everywhere in the topology. Our experiments show that local caching and peer groups improve throughput and response time significantly, performance is not affected in offline mode, and that migration is seamless.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of fog and edge computing has complemented cloud computing in the design of pervasive, computing-intensive applications. The proximity of fog resources to data sources has contributed to minimizing network operating expenditure and has permitted latency-aware processing. Furthermore, novel approaches such as serverless computing change the structure of applications and challenge the monopoly of traditional Virtual Machine (VM)-based applications. However, the efforts directed to the modeling of cloud applications have not yet evolved to exploit these breakthroughs and handle the whole application lifecycle efficiently. In this work, we present a set of Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) extensions to model applications relying on any combination of the aforementioned technologies. Our approach features a design-time “type-level” flavor and a run time “instance-level” flavor. The introduction of semantic enhancements and the use of two TOSCA flavors enables the optimization of a candidate topology before its deployment. The optimization modeling is achieved using a set of constraints, requirements, and criteria independent from the underlying hosting infrastructure (i.e., clouds, multi-clouds, edge devices). Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of such an approach in comparison to other notable cloud application deployment approaches and provide directions for future research.},

abstract = {Recent work in networked systems has shown that using aerial imagery for farm monitoring can enable precision agriculture by lowering the cost and reducing the overhead of large scale sensor deployment. However, acquiring aerial imagery requires a drone, which has high capital and operational costs, often beyond the reach of farmers in the developing world. In this paper, we present TYE (Tethered eYE), an inexpensive platform for aerial imagery. It consists of a tethered helium balloon with a custom mount that can hold a smartphone (or a camera) with a battery pack. The balloon can be carried using a tether by a person or a vehicle. We incorporate various techniques to increase the operational time of the system, and to provide actionable insights even with unstable imagery. We develop path-planning algorithms and use that to develop an interactive mobile phone application that provides the user instant feedback to guide users to efficiently traverse large areas of land. We use computer vision algorithms to stitch orthomosaics by effectively countering wind-induced motion of the camera. We have used TYE for aerial imaging of agricultural land for over a year, and envision it as a low-cost aerial imaging platform for similar applications.},

abstract = {A farm’s soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity (EC) readings are extremely valuable for a farmer. They can help her reduce water use and improve productivity. However, the high cost of commercial soil moisture sensors and the inaccuracy of sub-1000 dollar EC sensors have limited their adoption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future in which a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in soil sensing equipment.},

Leveraging the modularity of microservice-based applications, we propose to deploy multiple instances of the same service (one per edge site) and deliver collaborations between them according to each request. Collaborations are expressed thanks to a DSL and orchestrated in a transparent manner by the Cheops runtime. We demonstrate the relevance of our proposal by geo-distributing Kubernetes resources.",
